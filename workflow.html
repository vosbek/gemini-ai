                <h2>Real-World AI Workflows for Large Codebases</h2>
                <p>Based on proven practices from developers working with production codebases. Modern agentic IDEs like Cursor handle context automatically - your job is to provide the right documentation and guidance.</p>
                
                <h3>üèóÔ∏è Foundation Setup (Do This Once)</h3>
                
                <div class="workflow-step">
                    <div class="step-number">1</div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Document Your Codebase Patterns</h4>
                        <div class="code-block"><strong>Create Documentation Files (Most Important Step):</strong>

üìÅ <strong>backend-patterns.md</strong> - Explain your backend structure
"Our API endpoints follow this pattern:
- Routes go in /routes/[resource].js
- Services handle business logic in /services/[resource]Service.js  
- Database queries use our custom ORM wrapper in /data/[resource]Repository.js
- Error handling: always use our ApiError class with consistent status codes"

üìÅ <strong>frontend-patterns.md</strong> - Document your UI patterns
"React components follow this structure:
- Use functional components with hooks
- State management with Zustand (not Context API)
- Forms use react-hook-form + zod validation
- Styling with Tailwind following our design system
- Error boundaries wrap all page-level components"

üìÅ <strong>database-patterns.md</strong> - Database conventions
üìÅ <strong>testing-patterns.md</strong> - Testing approach
üìÅ <strong>deployment-patterns.md</strong> - DevOps patterns

<strong>Why This Works:</strong> AI reads these files automatically and follows your patterns without you explaining every time.</div>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Create Smart .cursorrules File</h4>
                        <div class="code-block"><strong>Essential .cursorrules (Copy This):</strong>

# Core Behavior
- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request
- Never replace code with placeholders - always include complete code
- Break problems into smaller steps before implementing
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING before making changes
- Don't change code randomly, ask if you're not sure

# Project Standards
- Follow patterns in [your-backend-patterns.md]
- Use existing components as examples, don't reinvent
- Reference similar existing files when creating new ones
- Maintain backwards compatibility unless explicitly told otherwise

# Quality Requirements
- Write comprehensive error handling
- Include proper TypeScript types
- Add meaningful tests for new functionality
- Follow our established naming conventions

<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Reference your pattern files in the rules so AI always checks them.</div>

                        <h4>Set Up Workspace for Context Awareness</h4>
                        <div class="code-block"><strong>Modern IDE Setup:</strong>

‚úÖ <strong>Let Cursor index everything</strong> - Don't manually manage files
‚úÖ <strong>Use @-references</strong> - Type @filename to include specific files
‚úÖ <strong>Keep workspace organized</strong> - AI works better with clean structure
‚úÖ <strong>Use meaningful folder names</strong> - AI understands purpose from structure
‚úÖ <strong>Regular reindexing</strong> - Hit reindex button in Cursor settings periodically

‚ùå <strong>Don't:</strong> Micromanage which files are "open"
‚ùå <strong>Don't:</strong> Close files to "help" the AI
‚ùå <strong>Don't:</strong> Open entire codebase in one workspace

<strong>Key Insight:</strong> Modern AI has context awareness - provide structure, not manual file management.</div>

                    <h4>Workflow 1: Adding New Feature</h4>
                    <div class="code-block"><strong>Step 1: Plan First (Co-write with AI)</strong>
"I need to add user roles functionality. Let's plan this:
- What models/tables need changes?
- Which API endpoints are required?
- What UI components need updates?
- How does this integrate with existing auth?

Create a detailed implementation plan with file list and dependencies."

<strong>Step 2: Point to Existing Patterns</strong>
"Look at how user permissions are handled in @UserService.js and @PermissionMiddleware.js. 
Create the roles system following the same patterns for:
- Database structure
- API design
- Middleware implementation
- Error handling"

<strong>Step 3: Implement One File at a Time</strong>
"Start with the Role model in @models/Role.js. 
Follow the same structure as @models/User.js."

<strong>Step 4: Test Integration</strong>
"Now update @UserService.js to include role checking.
Make sure it integrates properly with existing authentication."

                    <h4>Workflow 2: Debugging Complex Issues</h4>
                    <div class="code-block"><strong>Step 1: Provide Complete Context</strong>
"I'm getting [exact error message] when users try to [specific action].

Error occurs in: @ComponentName.tsx
Related files: @ServiceName.js, @types/User.ts
Reproduction: [exact steps]
Browser console: [paste relevant logs]"

<strong>Step 2: Ask for Analysis First</strong>
"Before suggesting fixes, analyze this error:
1. What's the likely root cause?
2. What files are involved in this flow?
3. What should we check first?
4. Are there any related issues to watch for?"

<strong>Step 3: Get Targeted Fix</strong>
"Based on your analysis, provide a specific fix for [the identified issue].
Maintain the existing patterns in @RelatedFile.js.
Explain why this fix addresses the root cause."

<strong>Step 4: Prevent Regression</strong>
"What tests should we add to prevent this issue from happening again?
Create the tests following patterns in @existing.test.js"

<strong>Key Insight:</strong> AI is excellent at analysis when given complete context.</div>

                    <h4>Workflow 3: Understanding Legacy Code</h4>
                    <div class="code-block"><strong>Step 1: High-Level Overview</strong>
"Analyze @LegacyComponent.tsx and explain:
1. What is this component's main responsibility?
2. How does it fit into the overall application flow?
3. What are its key dependencies and integrations?
4. What patterns does it follow that I should maintain?"

<strong>Step 2: Specific Function Analysis</strong>
"Focus on the @handleComplexOperation method:
- What does it do step by step?
- What business rules does it implement?
- What are the potential failure points?
- How should I safely modify it?"

<strong>Step 3: Modification Strategy</strong>
"I need to add [specific change]. Based on the existing code:
1. What's the safest approach?
2. Which files need updates?
3. What existing patterns should I follow?
4. What could break and how to prevent it?"

<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use AI to understand before modifying - it's excellent at code analysis.</div>

                    <div class="code-block"><strong>Step 1: Generate Comprehensive Tests</strong>
"Looking at @ExistingService.test.js patterns, create tests for the new UserRoleService:

- Unit tests for all public methods
- Integration tests with database
- Error handling for edge cases
- Performance tests for bulk operations

Follow our testing conventions and use the same mocking patterns."

<strong>Step 2: Implement to Pass Tests</strong>
"I have these failing tests: [paste test file]

Implement UserRoleService to make all tests pass.
Follow the patterns in @UserService.js for:
- Error handling
- Database operations
- Validation logic"

<strong>Step 3: Iterate on Edge Cases</strong>
"The tests are passing but let's add coverage for:
- What happens with invalid role hierarchies?
- How do we handle concurrent role changes?
- What about users with multiple roles?

Add tests and update implementation."

"Review this @NewFeature.js for production readiness:

**Security Review:**
- Input validation and sanitization
